Hot summers spent in compression binders are ruthless, dysphoric, and extremely taxing on all fronts- the gift and opportunity for physical deliverance is an act of resistance towards the internal/external constructs that bind.

This painting is meant to depict the feeling of leaving behind the cisgender gaze when developing a relationship with yourself. Here, the armor, which is fashioned after a stereotypical chiseled manâ€™s torso and chest, is left behind as a trans masculine figure carries on into the beauty the natural world has to offer.",
  "scott-w-description": "As above, so below. Baphomet is already a gender ambiguous symbol, and one I connect to deeply. It represents equality, intellectualism, balance, and my favorite; Individual expression. Despite Baphomet's scary appearance, I think the message and symbolism is beautiful."
